## Heroku Deployment

## Description

This is an expense tracker website. You create an account or login to access your dashboard. On the dashboard you can add expenses you have and keep track of how much you've spent and where. There is a section above the expenses that tracks the total amount of all your expenses. In the future I would like to implement a photo upload system to electronically store receipts as well as graphs to track the types of expenses you have and display them. I also would like to implement categories for your expenses.

## Installation

You will need to run: npm install in your terminal to have all the required packages.
